RizeOS: A Next-Generation Job & Networking Portal
-
This is a full-stack web application built as a core team intern assessment for RizeOS. The project is inspired by platforms like LinkedIn and Upwork, with a unique blend of Web3, AI, and modern web technologies.

Features
-
Task 1: Full-Stack Product Development
-
Module 1: Authentication & Profile Management
-
User Authentication: Secure registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.

Profile Management: A dedicated "My Profile" page to view user data and a separate "Edit Profile" page to update information such as bio, skills, and linked accounts.

Module 2: Job Posting & Feed
-
Job Listings: A public feed that displays all job postings.

Search & Filtering: A dynamic search bar that allows users to filter jobs by title, description, and skills.

Job Posting: A protected page for authenticated users to post new job listings.

Module 3: Blockchain Payment Integration
-
Phantom Wallet: Seamless integration with the Phantom wallet for secure transactions.

Solana Devnet: A platform fee of 0.01 SOL is required to post a job, demonstrating a clear monetization model. The transaction is verified on the Solana Devnet.

Payment Logging: Implemented the optional feature to log all successful payments on the backend for audit purposes.

Module 4: AI Enhancements
-
Job Matching: A backend endpoint uses a powerful LLM to calculate a "match score" between a user's profile and a job listing. This provides an intelligent, data-driven experience.

AI Chatbot: A separate chatbot feature, powered by Groq, provides a friendly, knowledgeable assistant to answer questions about the platform and the tech industry.

Task 2: Go-To-Market (GTM) & Monetization Strategy
-
A detailed GTM and monetization plan is part of the final video demo. It covers a target user base, a 3-month roadmap, and a marketing plan.
